                        Hi, I'm a tech enthusiast who's been in the field for almost ten years. I've dabbled in a bit of everything, from competitive programming to machine learning. I love tackling tough problems - my expertise spans competitive programming, advanced algorithms, and machine learning.
                    </p>

                        I've had the chance to work on some very interesting projects, with both leading AI teams and developing healthcare optimization solutions. I enjoy diving into both the front-end and back-end, making sure everything works smoothly and looks great.
                    </p>

                        Outside of work, I try to keep a good balance. I love spending time with my son, and when I can, I hit the trails for a hike, climb some rocks, or get lost in a good strategy game.
