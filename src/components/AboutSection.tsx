                        I'm a coder who loves building stuff. I've been writing code for almost 10 years in different areas. I dig competitive programming, algorithms, optimization, and machine learning.

                        I enjoy solving tough problems and working across all parts of tech, from UI to algorithm design. I've built AI projects and led teams that shipped real products.

                        I love tackling hard projects. If I'm not coding, and not playing with my son, I might go hiking, bouldering, or play some strategy games.
